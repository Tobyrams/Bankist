This is a website that I coded along during a JavaScript course with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). 
The website  uses advanced DOM concepts and event listiners to achieve fancy hovers, smooth scrolling, scroll animations, page navigations, tabbed components, menu fade animations, lazy image loading and slider components.
[Bankist Website](https://tobyrams.github.io/Bankist/) **(Not yet responsive on Mobile)**
 ## Features

 - **Button Scrolling:**  When user clicks 'learn more' they will scrool into the view of the features section.
 - **Page Navigation:** Clicking on navbar like 'Operations' will direct user to the Operations section.
 - **Tabbed Component** This will display different infomation based on which tab component is active.
 - **Manu fade animation** This makes the sections slowly fade-in as the user scrolls down the website 
 - **Lazy loading images** This will load low quality images first then one in better resolution for better website performance 
 - **Slider Component** This is the component that has the 'user' reviews about the bank application
